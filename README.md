## Project Description

This project will be my Portfolio as a Developer, and also my very first Project on Github! Here, I will display projects I've worked on throughout this course thus far showcasing (also improving and practicing) the skills I've learned the past few weeks--HTML, CSS, Javascript, Responsive Design, JQuery, and Ajax.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
